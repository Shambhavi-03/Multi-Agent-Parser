Subject: Possible Invoice Fraud =E2=80=93 Verification Needed Before Payment

Hi [Accounts Payable Team],

We recently received an invoice from a new vendor claiming to represent [Vend=
or Company], but the bank details provided differ from those on file. The inv=
oice amount is significant, and I am concerned this could be a case of invoic=
e fraud.

Please verify the legitimacy of this invoice directly with the vendor before =
processing any payments. I have attached the invoice for your reference.

Best,
Louis Jennings
