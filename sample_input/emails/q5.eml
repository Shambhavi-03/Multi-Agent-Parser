Subject: Concern: Unusual Payment Request from Supplier

Dear [Finance Department],

Today, I received a payment request from Taylor-Brady with altered bank accou=
nt details and a sense of urgency to process the payment. This is unusual and=
 raises concerns about possible fraud.

Please contact the supplier using previously verified contact information to =
confirm the authenticity of this request before making any payments. Let me k=
now if you need any further information from my end.

Thank you for treating this as a priority.

Best,
Jacob Phillips
