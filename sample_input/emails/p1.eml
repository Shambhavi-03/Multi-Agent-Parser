Dear Brooks LLC,

I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the delayed delivery=

2025. As of today, we have not received the shipment, nor have we received an=
y updates regarding the revised delivery date.

We expect a prompt resolution and compensation for any losses incurred due to=
