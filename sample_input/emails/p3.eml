Subject: Service Complaint =E2=80=93 Unresolved Support Ticket #7890

Dear [Company Name],

I am disappointed with the customer support I have received regarding support=
 ticket #7890. Despite multiple follow-ups over the past two weeks, my issue =
remains unresolved, and I have not received any meaningful updates.

This level of service does not meet our expectations as a long-term client. I=
 request that this matter be escalated to a senior representative and resolve=
d within the next 48 hours.

Best,
Michael Wright
