Subject: Alert: Unauthorized Access Attempt to Company Systems

Dear [IT/Security Team],

Earlier today, I received multiple notifications of failed login attempts to =
my company account from an unrecognized IP address. This raises concerns abou=
t a potential security breach.

Please review the access logs for my account and implement additional securit=
y measures, such as two-factor authentication. Kindly keep me informed of you=
r findings and any actions taken.

Thank you for your immediate attention.

Best,
Elizabeth Baker
