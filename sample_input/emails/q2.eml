Subject: Report of Potential Phishing Attempt Targeting Employees

Hello [IT/Security Team],

Several employees have reported receiving emails from an address closely rese=
mbling our HR department, requesting sensitive personal and financial informa=
tion. The emails contain suspicious links and attachments.

I have attached a sample of the email for your review. Please investigate and=
 take steps to alert all employees, block the sender, and enhance our email s=
ecurity protocols.

Thank you for your swift action.

Best,
Charles Patterson
Office manager
